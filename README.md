# Pac-man-game

A Pac man like game.
This is the final project I completed for the Google-sponsored Computer Science computing Initiative (CSSI). I collaborated with two other team members:
Carlos Martinez, and Jacob

For this project, we were given a week to make something that demonstrated the skills we had learned during CSSI. The main object of this project was to 
attempt to recreate PacMan's ghost pathfinding algorithm with just a basic description of how the ghosts behaved.

We were able to get a working prototype of the ghost AI by the second day of the project. With the extra time we had, we tried to recreate a similar game
to Pacman. The game has 2 different powerups, one that gives you an extra life, and one that temporarily slows down the ghosts. We also made 2 additional maps that appear randomly whenever starting a new game. The coin generation algorithm, ghost AI, and player movement worked with any map we designed.


If you would like to set up and run this project, you can download the repository and open the index.html file in a web browser, our you can find an online Demo of the project here: https://Pac-Man-Project-1.armandode.repl.co
